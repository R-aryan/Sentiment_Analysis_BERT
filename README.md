# Sentiment Analysis BERT

Perform a Sentiment analysis using **BERT** on IMDB Movie Ratings Dataset. 


## About The Dataset

IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. The Dataset provides a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.

## BERT(State of the art language model for NLP)

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a recent paper published by researchers at Google AI Language. It has caused a stir in the Machine Learning community by presenting state-of-the-art results in a wide variety of NLP tasks, including Question Answering (SQuAD v1.1), Natural Language Inference (MNLI), and others.
